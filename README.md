### About
Hi! I am a programmer who mostly focuses on Python, but I also have and intrest 
in low-level languages. I am trying to learn C, ASM, and C++, and I want to learn
more about how computeres work on a really low level. I also love to do things with
Arduinos, and playing with HV. 

I only have 1 public repository with code, but I am working on alot of other things,
and they might be on my Github someday. I am working on a digitalized Science Bowl.
I dunno if it will really go anywhere.
